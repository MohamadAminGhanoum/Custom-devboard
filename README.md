# Custom-devboard
I will make custom devboard that i can use to create simple projects on my breadboard that do not require soldering. these projects could e.g be make light blink and control simple sensors.

During this hour, i worked on beginning with the set up of schematic. I followed the guide and learned new things, e.g about the decoupling capacitors and how they function in the circuit. I also learned about how the usb-c is connected in a circuit and what the different pins do.

The finished schematic diagram looks like this:

Then i began building and connecting components  pcb i have built:
The pcb i did was the most complex i have done so far, it was soo tricky because of the small space, especially when connecting to the rp2040 mcu. As seen in this picture, it was difficult to conenct som tracks in such a small spacing, so i had to do a lot of changes to achieve the ending result.

But now, i think the more complex part is here, i have 42 errors i should fix This actually takes a lot of time.

I got to fix all vital errors and ended only with the silkscreen crossing the edgecuts, and this error is normal, because i want the usb-c to go past the board-ending, so it does not matter, however the finished look for pcb looks like this:
